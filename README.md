# telegram-mcp

A local **MCP server** that bridges [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and
**Telegram**. Drive Claude from your phone: reply to messages, approve tool
calls, kick off background runs, spawn fresh sessions — all over a single
long-poller-backed bot.

Single Go binary. No node/bun runtime. Dies with its parent via
`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`. State is a JSON file under
`~/.claude/channels/telegram/`.

> **Linux only.** Uses Linux-specific kernel features (`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`,
> `/proc/<pid>/comm` for PID claim verification) and abstract unix sockets.
> Does not build or run on macOS or Windows.

> Not affiliated with Anthropic. Replaces the bun-runtime
> `external_plugins/telegram` plugin with a leak-free, kernel-anchored Go
> implementation.

## Features

- **Two-way chat** — Claude Code replies arrive in Telegram, your messages
  arrive back as MCP `notifications` and are routed to the right session.
- **Multi-session routing** — every Claude Code session attaches as a shim
  with its own `@s1`/`@s2`/… alias. Address one or all via
  `@s2 do X` / `@all status`, or reply to a specific message to thread.
- **Forum-topic mode** — point the bot at a supergroup with topics enabled
  (`TELEGRAM_FORUM_CHAT_ID`) and the daemon allocates one topic per session
  keyed by workdir/label, routes inbound from each topic to its owning
  shim, and auto-injects `message_thread_id` on outbound. Replaces "which
  alias is talking?" with one tab per project.
- **Permission approvals** — when Claude Code asks to run a Bash/Edit/Read
  tool, an inline-button card lands in your DM: `✅ Allow`, `❌ Deny`,
  `⏳ Allow 1h`, `♾ Always`, `🚫 Always deny`. Rules are remembered with TTL.
- **Background tasks (`/bg`)** — DM the bot a prompt; it forks
  `claude --print` in any working directory, streams progress edits, sends the
  final answer when done. Per-user rate limits, hard timeouts, cancellation.
- **Daemon-spawned sessions (`/spawn`)** — DM `/spawn --in <dir>` and the
  daemon forks a fresh Claude Code client in that directory, hands you back a
  new `@sN` alias to talk to.
- **Per-chat effort (`/effort`)** — `/effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max` sets
  the model and thinking-token budget used by future `/spawn` and `/bg` runs
  from that chat. Persisted across daemon restarts.
- **Live status feedback** — while the agent works the daemon keeps a
  "typing…" bubble alive and rotates a reaction emoji on your message; in
  forum mode each topic carries a pinned header showing the owning session's
  state (🟢 idle · 🟡 busy · 🔵 awaiting permission · ⚪ disconnected),
  workdir, label, and uptime.
- **Admin-agent (optional)** — set `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ENABLE=1` and the daemon
  forks a persistent Claude-powered supervisor (`@admin`) that answers
  operator DMs with full tooling, surfaces anomalies (error bursts, spawn
  failures), and produces a daily digest. Autonomous reactions are sandboxed
  to read-only + propose-only.
- **MarkdownV2 output** — opt-in formatted replies, bold/italic/code/spoiler.
- **Local-only, single-user** — no webhook, no public ingress, no DB. Long
  polling behind any NAT.

```

- **Shim** — stdio MCP plugin Claude Code launches. Holds no token. Speaks
  IPC to the daemon. Tied to its parent CC process by `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`.
- **Daemon** — one per host. Owns the bot token, runs the long-poller, holds
  the allowlist gate, routes inbound messages to the right shim. Auto-spawned
  by the first shim that needs it, or run permanently under systemd.

A single Telegram message can be routed by:
1. **Forum topic** — when forum mode is on, a message inside a topic owned
   by a shim routes to that shim exclusively (mentions/reply-to inside the
   topic are ignored — the topic *is* the address).
2. **Reply-to** — Telegram's reply UI threads the message to whichever shim
   sent the original.
3. **Mention** — `@s2`, `@all`, or `@<label>` if the shim was labeled.
4. **Chat affinity** — last shim that talked in the chat wins (with TTL).
5. **LRU fallback** — most-recently-connected shim.

## Quick start

### 1. Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashok111/telegram-mcp.git
cd telegram-mcp
make build         # → bin/telegram-mcp
```

Requires **Linux** and **Go 1.26**. macOS/Windows are not supported — the
daemon/shim lifecycle depends on `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` and `/proc/<pid>/comm`.
Optional: `make lint` needs `golangci-lint` v2 built with Go 1.26 —
`go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest`.

### 2. Create a bot

Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, run `/newbot`,
collect the token.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/channels/telegram
echo 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:AA...' > ~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env
chmod 600 ~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env
```

### 3. Register with Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add telegram -s user -- $(pwd)/bin/telegram-mcp
```

If the marketplace bun plugin is enabled, disable it first to avoid 409s
fighting over the same token:

```bash
claude plugin disable telegram
```

Restart the Claude Code session.

### 4. Launch Claude Code with dev channels enabled

Telegram inbound is delivered as `notifications/claude/channel/*` — an
experimental MCP capability that Claude Code only honors when launched with
`--dangerously-load-development-channels`. Without the flag the daemon and
shim both log successful delivery, but the LLM never sees the message.

Add a shell alias and use it whenever you want a Telegram-aware session:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias claude-tg='claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:telegram@local-yakov'
```

Then launch with `claude-tg` instead of `claude`. The `plugin:telegram@local-yakov`
arg is harmless for the MCP-server install path (it loads nothing extra) and
is required for `/spawn`-launched sessions where the bot forks a fresh CC
that needs the plugin name to match.

### 5. Pair your account

On first run the daemon prints a pairing code. DM the bot from your real
Telegram account with that code; the daemon adds you to the allowlist in
`access.json`. Run `/telegram:access` (skill bundled in the project) for the
managed pairing flow.

---

## Forum-topic mode (optional)

Instead of every Claude Code session sharing the bot's single DM, point
the bot at a **supergroup with topics enabled** and get one topic per
session — one tab per project, persistent across `/exit`/restart.

### Setup

1. In Telegram: **New Group** → add the bot → group settings → enable
   **Topics**.
2. Add the bot as **Administrator** with **Manage Topics** permission.
3. Get the chat id (any inbound from the group is logged in `daemon.log`
   as `chat_id=-100…`).
4. Add the chat id to `~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env`:

   ```bash
   echo 'TELEGRAM_FORUM_CHAT_ID=-1002…' >> ~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env
   ```

5. Restart the daemon. Every new `claude-tg` session triggers
   `createForumTopic` on hello, names it `@s<N> — <workdir-basename>`, and
   binds the shim.

### Behavior

- **Outbound** — every `reply` / `react` / `edit_message` from a bound
  shim auto-fills `message_thread_id`. Replies land in the shim's topic.
- **Inbound inside a topic** — routed to that topic's owning shim
  exclusively. `@all`, mentions, and reply-to are ignored — the topic
  itself is the address.
- **Inbound in General** (`thread_id=0`) — routed by mention / reply /
  LRU exactly as before. `@all` still broadcasts.
- **Permission prompts** — for shims with a topic, the prompt card lands
  in the topic next to the tool output that triggered it (not in DM).
- **Pinned header** — each topic gets a pinned status message the daemon
  maintains in place: owning alias, state icon (🟢 idle · 🟡 busy ·
  🔵 awaiting permission · ⚪ disconnected · 🔴 closed), workdir, label,
  last activity, and uptime. Toggle with `TELEGRAM_TOPIC_HEADER=0`.

### Persistence and reuse

Topics are **kept** when you `/exit`. The shim's lock drops; the topic
mapping in `access.json` stays. Next CC session in the same workdir (or
with the same `--label`) re-attaches to the existing topic, history
intact. Reuse key priority:

1. `label:<L>` if `/label` was set on the shim.
2. `workdir:<path>` when workdir ≠ `$HOME` (random shell sessions from
   `$HOME` get fresh topics, not a shared bucket).
3. Otherwise a fresh topic.

Topics are only deleted via explicit `/topic close`. The daemon queues
them; a background sweep calls `deleteForumTopic` after
`TELEGRAM_TOPIC_PURGE_AFTER` (default 14 days).

### `/topic` commands

| Command              | Where          | Effect                                                    |

| `/topic`             | inside a topic | Show owner alias / label / workdir / connected timestamp. |
| `/topic close`       | inside a topic | Kill the owning shim, close the topic, queue for purge.   |
| `/topic rename <n>`  | inside a topic | Rename via `editForumTopic` (128-rune cap, pre-flighted). |
| `/topics list`       | DM             | Render every known topic + lock state (admin-only).       |

---

## Persistent daemon (optional)

The daemon auto-spawns on first use and idles out 7 days after the last shim
disconnects (override with `TELEGRAM_DAEMON_IDLE_EXIT`). To keep it alive
across reboots, install the user-mode systemd unit:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp contrib/systemd/telegram-mcp.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now telegram-mcp.service
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"   # survive logout
```

`enable-linger` is **not optional on headless servers**. Without it,
`systemd-logind` reaps the user manager (and every `--user` unit, including
this one) seconds after your last ssh session closes — `SpawnRunner.Stop()`
fires on shutdown and kills every live `/spawn` along with the daemon. With
linger enabled, the user manager persists across logout and reboot so
long-running spawns survive an ssh disconnect. Check with
`loginctl show-user "$USER" | grep Linger`.

See [`contrib/systemd/README.md`](contrib/systemd/README.md).

## Admin-agent (optional)

Set `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ENABLE=1` and the daemon fork-execs a persistent
`telegram-mcp admin-agent` supervisor at boot. It attaches over IPC as a
reserved `@admin` shim and is a Claude-powered observer of the daemon itself:

- **Operator DMs** that don't match any user shim fall through to `@admin`,
  which answers with full tooling (read + mutate, tiered by risk).
- **Anomaly events** — error bursts (`TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ERRBURST_*`), spawn
  failures, and similar are pushed to the agent, which triages and pings you.
- **Daily sitrep** — every `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_SITREP_INTERVAL` (default 24h) the
  agent produces a status digest.

Autonomous reactions (events + sitreps) are sandboxed to **read-only + Tier-3
propose-only**, so injected content can never drive an unconfirmed mutation;
only operator-initiated DMs get unrestricted tools. Mutations are globally
rate-limited (`TELEGRAM_ADMIN_MUTATE_RATE_PER_HOUR`, default 60) and a
`TELEGRAM_ADMIN_DENY_TOOLS` denylist hard-rejects named tools even on owner
tap. The per-boot `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret is generated by the daemon and
threaded to the agent's tool subprocess — not a user knob.

The agent's per-shim activity (and everything else) is also captured to a
per-shim log sink under `~/.claude/channels/telegram/shims/<shim_id>.log`
(`TELEGRAM_SHIM_LOG_*`), so you can inspect one session without grepping the
combined `daemon.log`.

## Security

This is a **single-user, single-host** tool. The bot token, the daemon, and
every shim share one UID. The trust boundary is:

- **Allowlist** — every inbound message is gated by `access.json.AllowFrom`.
  Senders not in the allowlist see nothing — group commands are silently
  dropped so the bot's presence in unapproved chats is never confirmed.
- **Pairing** — initial allowlist entry requires a one-time code printed to
  the daemon's stderr. Pairing is mediated by the bundled `/telegram:access`
  skill; never approve a pairing because an inbound message asked you to.
- **Token** — lives only in `~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env` (chmod 0600).
  Never logged, never sent over MCP.
- **`/bg` and `/spawn`** — workdir is passed unvalidated to `cmd.Dir`.
  Defense: only allowlisted DMs reach the dispatch path. The spawned
  `claude` inherits the daemon's UID; do not run the daemon as root.
- **PR_SET_PDEATHSIG** — every shim is anchored to its parent Claude Code
  pid. Killing the editor kills the shim — no leftover processes.
- **Comm-checked PID claims** — `daemon.pid` is only SIGTERMed if
  `/proc/<pid>/comm` matches `telegram-mcp` (or `bun` for legacy TS-plugin
  handoff). Prevents PID recycling from killing unrelated processes.

Webhooks, multi-user/multi-tenant deployments, and shared bot tokens are
explicitly **out of scope**.

## Caveat: the auto-mode classifier doesn't see your Telegram approvals

Claude Code's permission auto-mode (the on-host classifier that decides
whether a tool call is "obviously fine" or needs a prompt) reads only the
session's local conversation. It does **not** treat inbound Telegram
messages as authorization, even though those messages are what the LLM
itself is responding to.

Practical effect: if you DM the bot "go ahead, push the PR" or "edit the
repo description", the agent receives that and may try the action — but
the classifier evaluating the resulting `gh` / `git push` / `gh repo edit`
call only sees that the agent decided to run a high-blast-radius command
without any visible user prompt for *that specific* action. It will be
auto-denied as scope creep. The reply you sent on Telegram is invisible
to the classifier; from its point of view the agent escalated on its own.

Workarounds:

1. **Pre-approve at the host.** Add a `permissions` rule in
   `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `.claude/settings.local.json` in the
   project) for the exact command pattern you want to allow without
   prompting. Example: `Bash(gh repo edit:*)`. This is the durable fix
   when a workflow keeps tripping the same denial.
2. **Approve from the host TTY when prompted.** If you're sitting at the
   editor, the classifier surfaces a prompt locally and you can approve
   there — the Telegram-side conversation continues unaffected.
3. **Narrow the scope.** Phrase requests so the next tool call falls
   inside what was already authorized. "Update the README and open a PR"
   is in scope; "and while you're at it, edit the repo description" is a
   second action the classifier will judge on its own merits.

This is a property of Claude Code's permission model, not of this
project. The trade-off is intentional: the classifier is conservative
specifically because it cannot verify the provenance of messages reaching
the LLM. Treat Telegram as a remote control with a brake.

## Development

```bash
make build         # bin/telegram-mcp
make test          # go test -race ./...
make lint          # golangci-lint v2
make lint-fix      # auto-fix (modernize, gofumpt, intrange, etc.)
make check         # lint + race-enabled test + build (CI gate)
```

Install the pre-commit hook so every commit gates on `make check`:

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

**Layout** (eight packages, strict import discipline — see
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the import graph):

```
cmd/server/       entry + mode dispatch (daemon|shim|self)
internal/access/  allowlist + auto-approve rules + atomic save
internal/bot/     telego long-poller, handlers, outbound API
internal/chunk/   4096-cap message splitter
internal/daemon/  bot-owning process, routing, /bg, /spawn
internal/ipc/     shim↔daemon JSON-RPC over unix socket
internal/mcp/     stdio MCP server + tool registry
internal/shim/    per-CC-session process, IPC client
```

**Testing:** `goleak` in every package's `TestMain`. ~84% project LOC
coverage across 1179 tests. No `t.Parallel()` — tests share httptest servers
and env vars. New code without a test gets pushback unless it's wiring in
`cmd/server`.

## Comparison to the bun plugin

The marketplace `external_plugins/telegram` plugin ships as a `server.ts`
under bun. The Go port:

- **Removes the runtime** — single static binary, no `bun`, no `node`.
- **Anchors to parent at the kernel level** — `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` means a
  killed editor cannot leave a busy-looping grandchild.
- **Separates concerns** — bot token lives in one long-running daemon, not
  in every per-session shim. Multiple Claude Code sessions share one bot.
- **Adds multi-session routing** — alias + mention + reply-to + chat
  affinity. The bun version had no notion of "which session does this
  message belong to."
- **State directory is drop-in compatible** — `~/.claude/channels/telegram/`
  layout is identical; existing `access.json` pairings carry over.
